    "# Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This semester, all homeworks will be conducted through Google Colab notebooks. All code for the homework assignment will be written and run in this notebook. Running in Colab will automatically provide a GPU, but you may also run this notebook locally by following [these instructions](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/local-runtimes.html) if you wish to use your own GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will save images in the notebooks to use and fill out a given LaTeX template which will be submitted to Gradescope, along with your notebook code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Colab\n",
    "On the left-hand side, you can click the different icons to see a Table of Contents of the assignment, as well as local files accessible through the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to go to **Runtime -> Change runtime type** and select **GPU** as the hardware accelerator. This allows you to use a GPU. Run the cells below to get started on the assignment. Note that a session is open for a maximum of 12 hours, and using too much GPU compute may result in restricted access for a short period of time. Please start the homework early so you have ample time to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you load this notebook by clicking \"Open in Colab\" from github, you will need to save it to your own Google Drive to keep your work.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Tips\n",
    "In each homework problem, you will implement autoregressive models and run it on various datasets. Oftentime you will run it on two datasets (dataset 1 and dataset 2). In these cases, the expected outputs for dataset 1 are already provided to help as a sanity check.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to print whatever output (e.g. debugging code, training code, etc) you want, as the graded submission will be the submitted pdf with images.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you complete the assignment, download all of the images outputted in the results/ folder and upload them to the figure folder in the given latex template.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of freedom in this homework to design write and design your own models. Hyperparameters are given as a guide to show what worked for us, but feel free to explore and use what you find is best!\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the cells below to download and load up the starter code."

    "In this part, implement a simple Autoregressive Transformer to model binary MNIST and shapes images (same as Q2(a), but with a Transformer). \n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional notes about your transformer implementation:\n",
    " * iGPT uses learned positional encodings. We recommend to use those here as well. However, you may also use sinusoidal positional encodings if you wish (see the [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) paper)\n",
    " * Autoregressive transformer always predicts the **next** token, give prior tokens. iGPT has a special **\\<bos\\>** or beginning of sequence token at the start of every sequence every image. Make sure to include this in your implementation as well. You can generate unconditional sample by conditioning with the **\\<bos\\>** token.\n",
    " * While dropout is a common feature in transformer models, you do not need to add it (but may if you wish!).\n",
    " * Prebuilt transformers exist in some frameworks (i.e. pytorch). Don't just use an off the shelf implementation as the point of the exercise is to better understand the transformer architecture. Building the transformer from the ground up (use primitives such as Linear/Dense layers, LayerNorm, GeLU, Embedding)\n",
    " * Learning rate warmup and cos learning rate decay are often used when training transformers to improve training stability and improve performance. See if this helps your model! Try 1000 steps of warmup with a cosine learning rate decay.\n",

Specifically, we can cache the key and values at the multi attention layer to more quickly predict at each step.\n",

    " * For each index $i$, compute $Q_i$, $K_i$, $V_i$ for the current element\n",

    "## Part (a) Multimodal Text and Image Generation\n",
    "Implement and train an autoregressive (AR) model capable of handling both text and image data. The model should be designed to process sequences composed of concatenated text and image tokens in both orders (text followed by images and images followed by text). Additionally, the model should be capable of generating unconditional text and image samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Preprocessing:\n",
    "* Text Tokens: Map each unique word in the text data to a unique token. (Note that all text descriptions contain the exact same amount of words. This simplifies text processing, as you won't have to deal with sequences of different lengths as in Question 5)\n",
    "* Image Tokens: Quantize the image data into tokens using the VQVAE tokenizer from Problem 4.\n",
    "* In this problem, we have 2 modalities. Introduce an **\\<end of text\\>** token and an **\\<end of image\\>** token. After seeing such a token, the model should switch to sampling the next modality.\n",
    "* Formulate batches as sequences of concat([**\\<end of image\\>**, text_tokens, **\\<end of text\\>**, image_tokens]) and concat([**\\<end of text\\>**, image_tokens, **\\<end of image\\>**, text_tokens]). With a 50/50 split between each ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inference:\n",
    "* During inference, we cannot mix modality tokens. During sampling we can restrict the logits to only be within the relevant modality.\n",
    "* After **\\<end of image\\>**, only allow the model to sample text tokens (including **\\<end of text\\>**)\n",
    "* After **\\<end of text\\>**, only allow the model to sample image tokens (including **\\<end of image\\>**)\n",
    "* At the very start (conditioned on the **\\<bos\\>** token, only allow the model to sample one of (**\\<end of image\\>** or **\\<end of text\\>**))\n",
    "* As the model may not always correctly sample the **\\<end of image\\>** token before the image ends, you may add a rule to force the model to always sample the correct number of image tokens (49 tokens).\n",

    "3. 9 conditional samples based on provided text.\n",
